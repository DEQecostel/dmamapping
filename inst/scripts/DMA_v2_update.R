#script for updating a version 1 county DMA shapefile to version 2.
#Version 2 updates include adding missing NLCD data to polygon then reassigning DMAs based on the updated NLCD data.
#NLCD data is typically missing due to overlapping duplicate polygons.


#Calculate the majority NLCD code for each polygon then add the information to the NLCD data cells that are currently empty.
